## File upload

You can select a file to upload your data. Supported formats for now are: Excel files.

Make sure all your data is contained within the first sheet. Headers should be included and must use only **latin** characters (no cyrilics!) for variable naming. No spacing between words is allowed (use underscores).

**Always** check your data on a data check tab after the upload.
